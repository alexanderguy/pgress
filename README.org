#+TITLE: pgress

'Native' PostgreSQL client in JavaScript for direct connection via
WebSocket.  This API hasn't been locked down.  The code probably has
major bugs.  Exposing your PostgreSQL database to the Internet can be
a really bad idea.

-> Only use this if you know what you're doing. <-

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
var conn = new pg.PGState("ws://myserver/postgres-ws", "mydb", "myuser", "SomePassword");

await conn.connect();

var nowTime = await conn.simpleQuery("select now();");
console.log("time is:", nowTime);

#+END_SRC
